### Storing marker colour in Core Data for Term and Course list item displays
I got the idea to store RGB values from the colour the user selected as a marker colour when creating a new term or course in a Core Data object from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kay-B3jWjm8
I implemented it differently than in the video but used the general idea presented in the beginning.
