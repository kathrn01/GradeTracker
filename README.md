## Usage and Demo
### Adding A Term
#### The user may add a term name, start and end dates, and choose a marker colour.
The terms will display in a list on the main page, with the most recent start date at the top (they are ordered from most to least recent start date).
The user can edit these attributes in the term's main page, which is accessed by selecting the term from the main page.

## Features

## Testing
Tests have been written for the Course class so far, and more tests will be added (UI tests). The main functionality of correctly calculating the target grade for syllabus items in a course has been tested in the CourseTests class.

## Acknowledgements and Citations
### Storing marker colour in Core Data for Term and Course list item displays
I got the idea to store RGB values from the colour the user selected as a marker colour when creating a new term or course in a Core Data object from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kay-B3jWjm8
I implemented it differently than in the video but used the general idea presented in the beginning.

### Other
Other citations and sources are commented where used in the code. Usually for things like iOS bug workarounds, formatting, or minor details.
